# BMI-Predictor-Speech-to-text-integrated
An android app which takes human voice as input(Height, Weight, Age(optional)) and predicts his/her
BMI -> Body Mass Index
******************************************************************************************************
There are some basic BMI Calculator built by students when they start their android journey in which they ask the user to enter height, weight manually.

I thought of providing one extra feature into this app ie. Speech to text.

In this app the user is given both options of entering the data both manually and by their voice too.

Language -> Java

PS: There are few scenario where this app would crash :( but I tried to cover most of the test cases

I did not publish this app on playstore beacuse this is my first application in which I tried to integrate a new feature :)

Anyone willing to improve this app can go ahead :)
